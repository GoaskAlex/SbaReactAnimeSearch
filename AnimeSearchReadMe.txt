John Rodriguez, This a simple search from an open anime Api. Was Very challenging project. Understanding useEffect,and useState. Did many projects trying to understand Redux and other feats. Problem I had- When I would refresh one of my pages the site would crash, wouldnt reload the Api. This was Redux and routes. 

This simple Search pulls animes and displays images and about the show itslef.
